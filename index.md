Hey, I'm Kenny Peng. I'm currently an Embedded Engineer at [Vitalacy](https://vitalacy.com/about/), and I also do personal projects on [Github](https://github.com/colonelwatch) under the name colonelwatch.

At all times I find myself scanning the Internet for more information, and while it's always a rich library, again and again I've found texts that aren't accessible. That's not *just* because I can't download them. Most articles require being familiar with some kind of context---background knowledge that I may or may not have. So, after I finally come to understand them, I want the people looking at my work to understand too.

Hence, my aim is for you to plainly see what context comes into play in the below articles. I've tried to keep them from needing more than some calculus, linear algebra, and programming knowledge. I hope you find any of them elucidating.
